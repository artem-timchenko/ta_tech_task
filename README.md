This repo contains a solution for two technical tasks:
1. ec2.txt contains EC2 task solution;
2. Terraform code in `terraform` folder is for terraform task solution;

It's just a required solution, for real-world usage it will have lots of modifications, e.g:
- modules;
- proper tagging;
- remote state; 
- variables;
- configured pre-commit hooks;
